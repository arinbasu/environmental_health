## The purpose of this paper or experiment is 

1. To write using a jupyter notebook
2. Write everything here
3. Add references here using the latex citation commands (later, when I use markdown, in the markdown I can switch to the usual pandoc understandable citation commands)
4. use the markdown formatted document to generate a latex file and push the latex file to Overleaf
5. See how as I update this file, the latex file updates as well with some git commands.
6. Also generate a bibtex file from the Home button and then push it out to overleaf folder when I am done and bring it back to here when I want to write again (actually leave it here and copy it when I need to overwrite the Overleaf folder bit). 

## Why would I like to do it?

- Convenience
- Pleasure
- Unity



## Add a Table

Add a table in the usual markdown way

| What is | What if   |
|---------|---------  |
|What wows| What works|

And see how it works

## Add a reference and citation

Blair (2007) wrote about the methodological issues around exposure assessment in epidemiological studies \cite{Blair:2007cy}. We keep on writing and saving and see how these things will shape up the structure. 

## Add a figure is likewise easy

Add a figure from the net

These are the essential elements that we want to show off. The last thing we'd like to do is to add links.
